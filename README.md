## 📌 Project Overview

**EcoRide Car Rental System** is a robust **Java Console-based Application** designed for the administrative staff of EcoRide, a medium-sized car rental service in Colombo. The primary goal of this system is to streamline core business operations, including:
* Creating and managing records for vehicles, customers, and reservations.
* Calculating rental pricing and generating detailed invoices.

### Core Features

* **Vehicle Management:** Supports 4 distinct vehicle classes: Compact Petrol, Hybrid, Electric, and Luxury SUV, each with unique pricing, tax, and mileage rules.
* **Customer & Reservation Management:** Allows administrators to register customers and create reservations.
* **Invoice Generation:** Produces comprehensive invoices detailing all charges.
* **Data Structures:** All internal business logic utilizes dynamic data structures, specifically **ArrayLists**, for data storage without requiring an external database connection.
